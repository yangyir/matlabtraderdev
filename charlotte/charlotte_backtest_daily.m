%func to load existing trade if there is any
%func to generate new trade if there is a prop signal
%func to backtest the existing / newly-generated trade
%backtest is on a daily basis
%as to be inline with the code, we use the calendar time starting from
%09:00 an until 02:30 the next day (if it is needed)
%func inputs:
%   fut code (char), e.g. i2501
%   test date (char), e.g. 2024-09-06
%   freq (char), e.g.'30m',only '5m', '15m', '30m'(default value) and
%   '1440m' are supported
%   kelly tables directory(char)
%
%logic for newly-generated trades
%1.logic for trended trades
%   It is important to note that there could be unsuccessfully breaches of the
%   fractal barrier with trended condition satisfied, and these trades are
%   generated in realtime trading but exclueded from the current framework
%   of kelly calculation. We shall use this new framework to calculate and
%   analyse the stats of those trades.
%2.logic for non-trended trades
%   this shall be the same with the current backtest framework

%sample inputs:
testdt = '2024-09-05';
futcode = 'i2501';
freq = '30m';
[~,extrainfo] = charlotte_loaddata('futcode',futcode,'frequency',freq);

dt1 = [testdt,' 09:00:00'];
dt2 = [datestr(dateadd(datenum(testdt,'yyyy-mm-dd'),'1d'),'yyyy-mm-dd'),' 02:30:00'];
